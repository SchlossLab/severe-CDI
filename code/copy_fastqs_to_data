#Copies clinical CDI sample sequence data files from miseq_runs folder in schloss-lab turbo storage to my CDI_clinical_samples project directory. This script is a record of bash commands used, since it is just moving/renaming files there is no need to submit as a job. For each library, the water & mock fastqs will be renamed to match the CDI plate number they were in. After sequences from all libraries have been transferred to the project's raw data directory, we will remove the dashes, M#, and PBS parts of the sample names so that just the KR##### is left to make downstream analysis easier. All of the information about aliquots used and whether PBS was added to the samples is kept track in the metadata.
#Note: We start off at plate 5, because 376 samples had already been sequenced by Micah and the microbiome core. Separate aliquots of each of those 376 samples were sequenced by the Schloss lab so that all 3943 samples are represented below.)
