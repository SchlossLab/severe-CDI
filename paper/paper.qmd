# Introduction

A few ways to define CDI severity (@fig-flowchart)

# Results

## Model performance

Report median AUROC for trainset and testset, and median AUBPRC for testset (@fig-performance).

## Feature importance

(@fig-features)

## Clinical value of severity prediction models

# Discussion

TODO

# Materials and Methods

## Sample collection and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing

[@schloss_introducing_2009]

## Defining CDI severity

IDSA definition of severe CDI based on lab values.
CDC definiton of severe CDI based on disease-related complications [@mcdonald_recommendations_2007].

## Model training and evaluation

[@topcuoglu_mikropml_2021]

### Balanced precision

## Code and data availability

[@sovacool_schtools_2022]

# Figures

::: {#fig-flowchart fig-cap="**CDI severity definitions.**
A) Decision flow chart to define CDI cases as severe according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) based on lab values,
the occurence of complications due to any cause (All-cause),
and the occurence of disease-related complications confirmed as attributable to CDI with chart review (Attrib).
B) The proportion of severe CDI cases labelled according to each definition.
An additional 'Pragmatic' severity definition uses the Attributable definition when possible,
and falls back to the All-cause definition when chart review is not available.

Area Under the Receiver-Operator Characteristic Curve (AUROC) for the cross-validation trainsets and testsets,
and the Area Under the Balanced Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) for the testsets.
Left: models were trained on the full dataset, with different numbers of samples available for each severity definition.
Right: models were trained on the intersection of samples with all labels available for each definition.
