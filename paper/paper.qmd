## Sample collection

This study was approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review
Board. All patient samples were collected by the University of Michigan Health
System from January 2016 through December 2017.
Stool samples that had unformed stool consistency were tested for *C. difficile* by
the clinical microbiology lab with a two-step algorithm that included detection
of *C. difficile* glutamate dehydrogenase and toxins A and B by enzyme
immunoassay with reflex to PCR for the *tcdB* gene when results were discordant.
1,517 stool samples were collected from patients diagnosed with a CDI.
Leftover stool samples that were sent to the clinical microbiology lab were
collected and split into different aliquots.
For 16S sequencing, the aliquot of stool was resuspended in
DNA genotek stabilization buffer and then stored in the -80&deg;C freezer.
Only the first CDI sample per patient was used for subsequent ML analyses such
that no patient is represented more than once, resulting in a dataset of 1,191
samples.

## 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing

Samples stored in DNA genotek buffer were thawed from the -80&deg;C, vortexed,
and then transferred to a 96-well bead beating plate for DNA extractions.
DNA was extracted using the DNeasy
Powersoil HTP 96 kit (Qiagen) and an EpMotion 5075 automated pipetting system
(Eppendorf).
The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified with the AccuPrime
Pfx DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using custom barcoded primers, as
previously described [@kozich_development_2013].
Each library preparation plate for
sequencing contained a negative control (water) and mock community control
(ZymoBIOMICS microbial community DNA standards).
The PCR amplicons were
normalized (SequalPrep normalizatin plate kit from Thermo Fisher Scientific),
pooled and quantified (KAPA library quantification kit from KAPA Biosystems),
and sequenced with the MiSeq system (Illumina).

All sequences were processed with mothur (v1.43) using the MiSeq SOP protocol
[@schloss_introducing_2009; @kozich_development_2013].
Paired sequencing reads were combined and
aligned with the SILVA (v132) reference database [@quast_silva_2013] and taxonomy was
assigned with a modified version of the Ribosomal Database Project reference
sequences (v16) [@cole_ribosomal_2014].
Samples were rarefied to 5,000 sequences per sample, repeated 1,000
times for alpha and beta diversity analysis.

## Defining CDI severity

IDSA definition of severe CDI based on lab values.
CDC definiton of severe CDI based on disease-related complications [@mcdonald_recommendations_2007].

## Model training and evaluation

mikropml R package [@topcuoglu_mikropml_2021]

Balanced precision

The workflow was defined with Snakemake [@koster_snakemake_2012] using a custom
version of the mikropml Snakemake workflow [@sovacool_mikropml_2023].
Dependencies were managed with conda environments.
Scripts were written in R [@r_core_team_r_2020],
Python [@van_rossum_python_2009],
and GNU bash.

creation of this manuscript include
cowplot [@wilke_cowplot_2020],
ggtext [@wilke_ggtext_2020],
ggsankey [@sjoberg_ggsankey_2022],
schtools [@sovacool_schtools_2022],
the tidyverse metapackage [@wickham_welcome_2019],
Quarto, and
vegan [@oksanen_vegan_2023].

## Data availability

The 16S rRNA sequencing data have been deposited in the National Center for
Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive
(BioProject Accession no. PRJNA729511).

::: {#fig-flowchart fig-cap="**CDI severity definitions.**
A) Decision flow chart to define CDI cases as severe according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) based on lab values,
the occurence of complications due to any cause (All-cause),
and the occurence of disease-related complications confirmed as attributable to CDI with chart review (Attrib).
B) The proportion of severe CDI cases labelled according to each definition.
An additional 'Pragmatic' severity definition uses the Attributable definition when possible,
and falls back to the All-cause definition when chart review is not available.
