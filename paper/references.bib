  abstract = {Both the American College of Gastroenterology and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America 2021 Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) guidelines recommend fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for persons with multiple recurrent CDI. Emerging data suggest that FMT may have high cure rates when used for first recurrent CDI. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of FMT for first recurrent CDI.We developed a Markov model to simulate a cohort of patients presenting with initial CDI infection. The model estimated the costs, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of different CDI treatment regimens recommended in the 2021 IDSA guidelines, with the additional option of FMT for first recurrent CDI. The model includes stratification by the severity of initial infection, estimates of cure, recurrence, and mortality. Data sources were taken from IDSA guidelines and published literature on treatment outcomes. Outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).When FMT is available for first recurrent CDI, the optimal cost-effective treatment strategy is fidaxomicin for initial nonsevere CDI, vancomycin for initial severe CDI, and FMT for first and subsequent recurrent CDI, with an ICER of \$27 135/QALY. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis at a \$100 000 cost-effectiveness threshold, FMT for first and subsequent CDI recurrence was cost-effective 90\% of the time given parameter uncertainty.FMT is a cost-effective strategy for first recurrent CDI. Prospective evaluation of FMT for first recurrent CDI is warranted to determine the efficacy and risk of recurrence.},

  abstract = {Motivation: In life sciences, interpretability of machine learning models is as important as their prediction accuracy. Linear models are probably the most frequently used methods for assessing feature relevance, despite their relative inflexibility. However, in the past years effective estimators of feature relevance have been derived for highly complex or non-parametric models such as support vector machines and RandomForest (RF) models. Recently, it has been observed that RF models are biased in such a way that categorical variables with a large number of categories are preferred.Results: In this work, we introduce a heuristic for normalizing feature importance measures that can correct the feature importance bias. The method is based on repeated permutations of the outcome vector for estimating the distribution of measured importance for each variable in a non-informative setting. The P-value of the observed importance provides a corrected measure of feature importance. We apply our method to simulated data and demonstrate that (i) non-informative predictors do not receive significant P-values, (ii) informative variables can successfully be recovered among non-informative variables and (iii) P-values computed with permutation importance (PIMP) are very helpful for deciding the significance of variables, and therefore improve model interpretability. Furthermore, PIMP was used to correct RF-based importance measures for two real-world case studies. We propose an improved RF model that uses the significant variables with respect to the PIMP measure and show that its prediction accuracy is superior to that of other existing models.Availability: R code for the method presented in this article is available at http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/{$\sim$}altmann/download/PIMP.RContact:altmann@mpi-inf.mpg.de, laura.tolosi@mpi-inf.mpg.deSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Background Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is effective for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), but inconsistent effect rates and uncertain evidence levels have warranted caution. To clarify, we aimed to establish the evidence of FMT for recurrent CDI, updated across different delivery methods, treatment regimens, and in comparison with standard antibiotics. Methods In this updated systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Clinical Key, and Svemed+ for FMT literature published in English until November 11, 2019. We included observational and clinical trials with or without antibiotic comparators and excluded studies with below 8 weeks follow-up and fewer than 15 patients. The primary outcome was clinical outcome by week 8. We comprehensively extracted patient and procedural data. In a random-effects meta-analysis, we estimated the clinical effect for repeat or single FMT, different delivery methods, and versus antibiotics. We rated the evidence according to the Cochrane and GRADE methods. The PROSPERO preregistration number is CRD42020158112. Findings Of 1816 studies assessed, 45 studies were included. The overall clinical effect week 8 following repeat FMT (24 studies, 1855 patients) was 91\% (95\% CI: 89\textendash 94\%, I2=53\%) and 84\% (80\textendash 88\%, I2=86\%) following single FMT (43 studies, 2937 patients). Delivery by lower gastrointestinal endoscopy was superior to all other delivery methods, and repeat FMT significantly increased the treatment effect week 8 (P{$<$}0{$\cdot$}001). Compared with vancomycin, the number needed to treat (NNT) for repeat FMT was 1{$\cdot$}5 (1{$\cdot$}3\textendash 1{$\cdot$}9, P{$<$}0{$\cdot$}001) and 2.9 (1{$\cdot$}5\textendash 37{$\cdot$}1, P=0{$\cdot$}03) for single FMT. Repeat FMT had high quality of evidence. Interpretation High-quality evidence supports FMT is effective for recurrent CDI, but its effect varies with the delivery method and the number of administrations. The superior NNT for FMT compared with antibiotics suggests that patients may benefit from advancing FMT to all instances of recurrent CDI. Funding Innovation Fund Denmark (j.no. 8056-00006B).},

Guidelines released by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (IDSA/SHEA) and ESCMID had some consensus as well as some discrepancies in disease severity classification and treatment recommendations. We review and compare the key clinical strategies from updated IDSA/SHEA, ESCMID and current Australasian guidelines for CDI management in adults and discuss relevant issues for clinicians, particularly in the management of severe-complicated infection.             Updated IDSA/SHEA and ESCMID guidelines now reflect the increased efficacy of fidaxomicin in preventing recurrence and have both promoted fidaxomicin to first-line therapy with an initial CDI episode in both non-severe and severe disease and endorsed the role of bezlotoxumab in the prevention of recurrent infection. Vancomycin remains acceptable therapy and metronidazole is not preferred. For severe-complicated infection the IDSA/SHEA recommends high-dose oral{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}rectal vancomycin and IV metronidazole, whilst in an important development, ESCMID has endorsed fidaxomicin and tigecycline as part of combination anti-CDI therapy, for the first time. The role of faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in second CDI recurrence is now clearer, but timing and mode of FMT in severe-complicated refractory disease still requires further study.},

Fidaxomicin, which inhibits RNA polymerase, targets Cdiff with minimal effects on gut commensals, reducing recurrence of Cdiff infection2,3. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of Cdiff RNA polymerase in complex with fidaxomicin and identify a crucial fidaxomicin-binding determinant of Cdiff RNA polymerase that is absent in most gut microbiota such as Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. By combining structural, biochemical, genetic and bioinformatic analyses, we establish that a single residue in Cdiff RNA polymerase is a sensitizing element for fidaxomicin narrow-spectrum activity.

  abstract = {Background Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) can lead to complications, recurrence, and death. Numerous studies have assessed risk factors for these unfavourable outcomes, but systematic reviews or meta-analyses published so far were limited in scope or in quality. Methods A systematic review was completed according to PRISMA guidelines. An electronic search in five databases was performed. Studies published until October 2013 were included if risk factors for at least one CDI outcome were assessed with multivariate analyses. Results 68 studies were included: 24 assessed risk factors for recurrence, 18 for complicated CDI, 8 for treatment failure, and 30 for mortality. Most studies accounted for mortality in the definition of complicated CDI. Important variables were inconsistently reported, such as previous episodes and use of antibiotics. Substantial heterogeneity and methodological limitations were noted, mainly in the sample size, the definition of the outcomes and periods of follow-up, precluding a meta-analysis. Older age, use of antibiotics after diagnosis, use of proton pump inhibitors, and strain type were the most frequent risk factors for recurrence. Older age, leucocytosis, renal failure and co-morbidities were frequent risk factors for complicated CDI. When considered alone, mortality was associated with age, co-morbidities, hypo-albuminemia, leucocytosis, acute renal failure, and infection with ribotype 027. Conclusion Laboratory parameters currently used in European and American guidelines to define patients at risk of a complicated CDI are adequate. Strategies for the management of CDI should be tailored according to the age of the patient, biological markers of severity, and underlying co-morbidities.},

BZX was used mostly in immunosuppressed patients (66.7\%) and in first episodes or first recurrences in 70.6\% of the cases. FMT was prescribed only in CDI recurrences. Despite the different conditions of the patients, there were no significant differences between BZX and FMT in preventing early rCDI (19.6\% vs 24.5\%; P = .55) or late rCDI (9.8\% vs 18.4\%; P = .31).

C. difficile infection (CDI) places a heavy burden on the healthcare system, with nearly half a million infections yearly and an approximate 20\% recurrence risk after successful initial therapy. The high incidence has driven new research on improved prevention such as the emerging use of probiotics, intestinal microbiome manipulation during antibiotic therapies, vaccinations, and newer antibiotics that reduce the disruption of the intestinal microbiome. While the treatment of acute C. difficile is effective in most patients, it can be further optimized by adjuvant therapies that improve the initial treatment success and decrease the risk of subsequent recurrence. Finally, the high risk of recurrence has led to multiple emerging therapies that target toxin activity, recovery of the intestinal microbial community, and elimination of latent C. difficile in the intestine. In summary, CDIs illustrate the complex interaction among host physiology, microbial community, and pathogen that requires specific therapies to address each of the factors leading to primary infection and recurrence.},

  abstract = {Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) can result in severe disease and death, with no accurate models that allow for early prediction of adverse outcomes. To address this need, we sought to develop serum-based biomarker models to predict CDI outcomes. We prospectively collected sera {$\leq$}48 h after diagnosis of CDI in two cohorts. Biomarkers were measured with a custom multiplex bead array assay. Patients were classified using IDSA severity criteria and the development of disease-related complications (DRCs), which were defined as ICU admission, colectomy, and/or death attributed to CDI. Unadjusted and adjusted models were built using logistic and elastic net modeling. The best model for severity included procalcitonin (PCT) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) with an area (AUC) under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.74 (95\% confidence interval, 0.67 to 0.81). The best model for 30-day mortality included interleukin-8 (IL-8), PCT, CXCL-5, IP-10, and IL-2R{$\alpha$} with an AUC of 0.89 (0.84 to 0.95). The best model for DRCs included IL-8, procalcitonin, HGF, and IL-2R{$\alpha$} with an AUC of 0.84 (0.73 to 0.94). To validate our models, we employed experimental infection of mice with C. difficile. Antibiotic-treated mice were challenged with C. difficile and a similar panel of serum biomarkers was measured. Applying each model to the mouse cohort of severe and nonsevere CDI revealed AUCs of 0.59 (0.44 to 0.74), 0.96 (0.90 to 1.0), and 0.89 (0.81 to 0.97). In both human and murine CDI, models based on serum biomarkers predicted adverse CDI outcomes. Our results support the use of serum-based biomarker panels to inform Clostridioides difficile infection treatment. IMPORTANCE Each year in the United States, Clostridioides difficile causes nearly 500,000 gastrointestinal infections that range from mild diarrhea to severe colitis and death. The ability to identify patients at increased risk for severe disease or mortality at the time of diagnosis of C. difficile infection (CDI) would allow clinicians to effectively allocate disease modifying therapies. In this study, we developed models consisting of only a small number of serum biomarkers that are capable of predicting both 30-day all-cause mortality and adverse outcomes of patients at time of CDI diagnosis. We were able to validate these models through experimental mouse infection. This provides evidence that the biomarkers reflect the underlying pathophysiology and that our mouse model of CDI reflects the pathogenesis of human infection. Predictive models can not only assist clinicians in identifying patients at risk for severe CDI but also be utilized for targeted enrollment in clinical trials aimed at reduction of adverse outcomes from severe CDI.},

Colectomy is standard of care; however, post-surgical mortality rates approach 50\%. Case reports suggest fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is a promising treatment of severe and severe-complicated disease but there is a paucity of data. Here, we present a single center experience with a novel sequential FMT protocol for patients refractory to maximal medical therapy. This approach consists of at least one FMT delivered via colonoscopy with criteria for repeat FMT and continued vancomycin therapy based on clinical response and pseudomembranes. Our cohort included 57 consecutive inpatients diagnosed with severe or severe-complicated CDI and treated with FMT. Overall, 91\% (52/57) experienced clinical cure at 1 month with a 100\% cure rate among severe CDI (n = 19) patients and an 87\% cure rate for severe-complicated CDI (n = 33) patients. For the cohort, the survival rate was 94.7\% at 1 month and 78.6\% at 3 months. There were no serious adverse events related to FMT including no procedure-related complications or perforation. There was no difference in outcome between fresh or frozen fecal material. Sequential FMT for inpatients with severe or severe-complicated CDI is promising and may be preferred over colectomy in certain patients.},

Disease complications as well as recurrent infections contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality. Over the past decades, there has been a rapid increase in the incidence of C. difficile infection (CDI), with a rise in the number of community-acquired cases. CDI has a profound economic impact on both the healthcare system and patients, secondary to recurrences, hospitalization, prolonged length of stay, cost of treatment, and indirect societal costs. With emergence of newer treatment options, the standard of care is shifting from metronidazole and vancomycin towards fidaxomicin and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which despite being more expensive, are more efficacious in preventing recurrences and hence overall are more beneficial forms of therapy per cost-effectiveness analyses. Data regarding preferred route of FMT, timing of FMT, and non-conventional therapies such as bezlotoxumab is scant. There is a need for further studies to elucidate the true attributable costs of CDI as well as continued cost-effectiveness research to reduce the economic burden associated with the disease and improve clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Objective To create and validate a simple and transferable machine learning model from electronic health record data to accurately predict clinical deterioration in patients with covid-19 across institutions, through use of a novel paradigm for model development and code sharing. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting One US hospital during 2015-21 was used for model training and internal validation. External validation was conducted on patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 at 12 other US medical centers during 2020-21. Participants 33 119 adults ({$\geq$}18 years) admitted to hospital with respiratory distress or covid-19. Main outcome measures An ensemble of linear models was trained on the development cohort to predict a composite outcome of clinical deterioration within the first five days of hospital admission, defined as in-hospital mortality or any of three treatments indicating severe illness: mechanical ventilation, heated high flow nasal cannula, or intravenous vasopressors. The model was based on nine clinical and personal characteristic variables selected from 2686 variables available in the electronic health record. Internal and external validation performance was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the expected calibration error\textemdash the difference between predicted risk and actual risk. Potential bed day savings were estimated by calculating how many bed days hospitals could save per patient if low risk patients identified by the model were discharged early. Results 9291 covid-19 related hospital admissions at 13 medical centers were used for model validation, of which 1510 (16.3\%) were related to the primary outcome. When the model was applied to the internal validation cohort, it achieved an AUROC of 0.80 (95\% confidence interval 0.77 to 0.84) and an expected calibration error of 0.01 (95\% confidence interval 0.00 to 0.02). Performance was consistent when validated in the 12 external medical centers (AUROC range 0.77-0.84), across subgroups of sex, age, race, and ethnicity (AUROC range 0.78-0.84), and across quarters (AUROC range 0.73-0.83). Using the model to triage low risk patients could potentially save up to 7.8 bed days per patient resulting from early discharge. Conclusion A model to predict clinical deterioration was developed rapidly in response to the covid-19 pandemic at a single hospital, was applied externally without the sharing of data, and performed well across multiple medical centers, patient subgroups, and time periods, showing its potential as a tool for use in optimizing healthcare resources.},

In the last 10 years, the field has moved from sequencing hundreds of 16S rRNA gene fragments per study using clone libraries to the sequencing of millions of fragments per study using next-generation sequencing technologies from 454 and Illumina. As these technologies advance, it is critical to assess the strengths, weaknesses, and overall suitability of these platforms for the interrogation of microbial communities. Here, we present an improved method for sequencing variable regions within the 16S rRNA gene using Illumina's MiSeq platform, which is currently capable of producing paired 250-nucleotide reads. We evaluated three overlapping regions of the 16S rRNA gene that vary in length (i.e., V34, V4, and V45) by resequencing a mock community and natural samples from human feces, mouse feces, and soil. By titrating the concentration of 16S rRNA gene amplicons applied to the flow cell and using a quality score-based approach to correct discrepancies between reads used to construct contigs, we were able to reduce error rates by as much as two orders of magnitude. Finally, we reprocessed samples from a previous study to demonstrate that large numbers of samples could be multiplexed and sequenced in parallel with shotgun metagenomes. These analyses demonstrate that our approach can provide data that are at least as good as that generated by the 454 platform while providing considerably higher sequencing coverage for a fraction of the cost.},

  abstract = {The severity of Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI) has increased over the last few decades. Patient age, white blood cell count, and creatinine levels as well as C. difficile ribotype and toxin genes have been associated with disease severity. However, it is unclear whether specific members of the gut microbiota are associated with variations in disease severity. The gut microbiota is known to interact with C. difficile during infection. Perturbations to the gut microbiota are necessary for C. difficile to colonize the gut. The gut microbiota can inhibit C. difficile colonization through bile acid metabolism, nutrient consumption, and bacteriocin production. Here, we sought to demonstrate that members of the gut bacterial communities can also contribute to disease severity. We derived diverse gut communities by colonizing germfree mice with different human fecal communities. The mice were then infected with a single C. difficile ribotype 027 clinical isolate, which resulted in moribundity and histopathologic differences. The variation in severity was associated with the human fecal community that the mice received. Generally, bacterial populations with pathogenic potential, such as Enterococcus, Helicobacter, and Klebsiella, were associated with more-severe outcomes. Bacterial groups associated with fiber degradation and bile acid metabolism, such as Anaerotignum, Blautia, Lactonifactor, and Monoglobus, were associated with less-severe outcomes. These data indicate that, in addition to the host and C. difficile subtype, populations of gut bacteria can influence CDI disease severity. IMPORTANCE Clostridioides difficile colonization can be asymptomatic or develop into an infection ranging in severity from mild diarrhea to toxic megacolon, sepsis, and death. Models that predict severity and guide treatment decisions are based on clinical factors and C. difficile characteristics. Although the gut microbiome plays a role in protecting against CDI, its effect on CDI disease severity is unclear and has not been incorporated into disease severity models. We demonstrated that variation in the microbiome of mice colonized with human feces yielded a range of disease outcomes. These results revealed groups of bacteria associated with both severe and mild C. difficile infection outcomes. Gut bacterial community data from patients with CDI could improve our ability to identify patients at risk of developing more severe disease and improve interventions that target C. difficile and the gut bacteria to reduce host damage.},

  abstract = {Background: Clostridium (Clostridioides) difficile infection (CDI) is a health care-associated infection that can lead to serious complications. Potential complications include intensive care unit (ICU) admission, development of toxic megacolon, need for colectomy, and death. However, identifying the patients most likely to develop complicated CDI is challenging. To this end, we explored the utility of a machine learning (ML) approach for patient risk stratification for complications using electronic health record (EHR) data. Methods: We considered adult patients diagnosed with CDI between October 2010 and January 2013 at the University of Michigan hospitals. Cases were labeled complicated if the infection resulted in ICU admission, colectomy, or 30-day mortality. Leveraging EHR data, we trained a model to predict subsequent complications on each of the 3 days after diagnosis. We compared our EHR-based model to one based on a small set of manually curated features. We evaluated model performance using a held-out data set in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results: Of 1118 cases of CDI, 8\% became complicated. On the day of diagnosis, the model achieved an AUROC of 0.69 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-0.83). Using data extracted 2 days after CDI diagnosis, performance increased (AUROC, 0.90; 95\% CI, 0.83-0.95), outperforming a model based on a curated set of features (AUROC, 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.75-0.91). Conclusions: Using EHR data, we can accurately stratify CDI cases according to their risk of developing complications. Such an approach could be used to guide future clinical studies investigating interventions that could prevent or mitigate complicated CDI.},

However, estimating the benefit of applying any single model to a specific clinical problem remains challenging today. Developing a shared framework for estimating model value is therefore critical to facilitate the effective, safe, and sustainable use of predictive tools into the future. We highlight key concepts within the prediction-action dyad that together are expected to impact model benefit. These include factors relevant to model prediction (including the number needed to screen) as well as those relevant to the subsequent action (number needed to treat). In the simplest terms, a number needed to benefit contextualizes the numbers needed to screen and treat, offering an opportunity to estimate the value of a clinical predictive model in action.},

  abstract = {Clostridioides difficile is the most common cause of infectious antibiotic-associated diarrhea, with disease mediated by two major toxins TcdA and TcdB. In severe cases, systemic disease complications may arise, resulting in fatal disease. Systemic disease in animal models has been described, with thymic damage an observable consequence of severe disease in mice. Using a mouse model of C. difficile infection, we examined this disease phenotype, focussing on the thymus and serum markers of systemic disease. The efficacy of bezlotoxumab, a monoclonal TcdB therapeutic, to prevent toxin mediated systemic disease complications was also examined. C. difficile infection causes toxin-dependent thymic damage and CD4+CD8+ thymocyte depletion in mice. These systemic complications coincide with changes in biochemical markers of liver and kidney function, including increased serum urea and creatinine, and hypoglycemia. Administration of bezlotoxumab during C. difficile infection prevents systemic disease and thymic atrophy, without blocking gut damage, suggesting the leakage of gut contents into circulation may influence systemic disease. As the thymus has such a crucial role in T cell production and immune system development, these findings may have important implications in relapse of C. difficile disease and impaired immunity during C. difficile infection. The prevention of thymic atrophy and reduced systemic response following bezlotoxumab treatment, without altering colonic damage, highlights the importance of systemic disease in C. difficile infection, and provides new insights into the mechanism of action for this therapeutic.Abbreviations: Acute kidney injury (AKI); Alanine Transaminase (ALT); Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST); C. difficile infection (CDI); chronic kidney disease (CKD); combined repetitive oligo-peptides (CROPS); cardiovascular disease (CVD); Double positive (DP); hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E); immunohistochemical (IHC); multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS); phosphate buffered saline (PBS); standard error of the mean (SEM); surface layer proteins (SLP); Single positive (SP); wild-type (WT).},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE. An estimated 293,300 healthcare-associated cases of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) occur annually in the United States. To date, research has focused on developing risk prediction models for CDI that work well across institutions. However, this one-size-fits-all approach ignores important hospital-specific factors. We focus on a generalizable method for building facility-specific models. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach using electronic health records (EHR) from the University of Michigan Hospitals (UM) and the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). METHODS. We utilized EHR data from 191,014 adult admissions to UM and 65,718 adult admissions to MGH. We extracted patient demographics, admission details, patient history, and daily hospitalization details, resulting in 4,836 features from patients at UM and 1,837 from patients at MGH. We used L2 regularized logistic regression to learn the models, and we measured the discriminative performance of the models on held-out data from each hospital. RESULTS. Using the UM and MGH test data, the models achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values of 0.82 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.80\textendash 0.84) and 0.75 ( 95\% CI, 0.73\textendash 0.78), respectively. Some predictive factors were shared between the 2 models, but many of the top predictive factors differed between facilities. CONCLUSION. A data-driven approach to building models for estimating daily patient risk for CDI was used to build institution-specific models at 2 large hospitals with different patient populations and EHR systems. In contrast to traditional approaches that focus on developing models that apply across hospitals, our generalizable approach yields risk-stratification models tailored to an institution. These hospital-specific models allow for earlier and more accurate identification of high-risk patients and better targeting of infection prevention strategies.},

  abstract = {Objective: Screening individuals admitted to the hospital for Clostridioides difficile presents opportunities to limit transmission and hospital-onset C. difficile infection (HO-CDI). However, detection from rectal swabs is resource intensive. In contrast, machine learning (ML) models may accurately assess patient risk without significant resource usage. In this study, we compared the effectiveness of swab surveillance to daily risk estimates produced by an ML model to identify patients who will likely develop HO-CDI in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Design: A prospective cohort study was conducted with patient carriage of toxigenic C. difficile identified by rectal swabs analyzed by anaerobic culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A previously validated ML model using electronic health record data generated daily risk of HO-CDI for every patient. Swab results and risk predictions were compared to the eventual HO-CDI status. Patients: Adult inpatient admissions taking place in University of Michigan Hospitals' medical and surgical intensive care units and oncology wards between June 6th and October 8th, 2020. Results: In total, 2,979 admissions, representing 2,044 patients, were observed over the course of the study period, with 39 admissions developing HO-CDIs. Swab surveillance identified 9 true-positive and 87 false-positive HO-CDIs. The ML model identified 9 true-positive and 226 false-positive HO-CDIs; 8 of the true-positives identified by the model differed from those identified by the swab surveillance. Conclusion: With limited resources, an ML model identified the same number of HO-CDI admissions as swab-based surveillance, though it generated more false-positives. The patients identified by the ML model were not yet colonized with C. difficile. Additionally, the ML model identifies at-risk admissions before disease onset, providing opportunities for prevention.},

Outcomes included severe CDI (intensive care unit admission, colectomy, or death attributable to CDI within 30 days of diagnosis) and 30-day all-cause mortality. Adjusted models were developed to test hypotheses and predict outcomes.Results.{$\quad$}In total, 1144 cases were included. The toxin EIA was positive in 37.2\% and 35.6\% of patients were of age \&gt;65 years. One of the 137 unique ribotypes was ribotype 027 (16.2\%). Detectable stool toxin did not associate with outcomes. Adjusting for covariates, including age, Ribotype 027 was a significant predictor of severe CDI (90 cases; odds ratio [OR], 1.73; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.03\textendash 2.89; P = .037) and mortality (89 cases; OR, 2.02; 95\% CI, 1.19\textendash 3.43; P = .009).

Design: Number needed to screen was calculated from clinical trials that directly measured the effect of a screening strategy. From clinical trials that measured treatment benefit, the number needed to screen was estimated as the number needed to treat from the trial divided by the prevalence of heretofore unrecognised or untreated disease. Directly calculated values were then compared with estimate number needed to screen values. Subjects: Standard literature review. Results: For prevention of total mortality the most effective screening test was a lipid profile. The estimated number needed to screen for dyslipidaemia (low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration {$>$}4.14 mmol/1) was 418 if detection was followed by pravastatin treatment for 5 years. This indicates that one death in 5 years could be prevented by screening 418 people. The estimated number needed to screen for hypertension was between 274 and 1307 for 5 years (for 10 mm Hg and 6 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure reduction respectively) if detection was followed by treatment based on a diuretic. Screening with haemoccult testing and mammography significantly decreased cancer specific, but not total, mortality. The number needed to screen for haemoccult screening to prevent a death from colon cancer was 1374 for 5 years, and the number needed to screen for mammography to prevent a death from breast cancer was 2451 for 5 years for women aged 50-59. Conclusion: These data allow the clinician to prioritise screening strategies. Of the screening strategies evaluated, screening for, and treatment of, dyslipidaemia and hypertension seem to produce the largest clinical benefit.},

  abstract = {Antibiotic usage is the most commonly cited risk factor for hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile infections (CDI). The increased risk is due to disruption of the indigenous microbiome and a subsequent decrease in colonization resistance by the perturbed bacterial community; however, the specific changes in the microbiome that lead to increased risk are poorly understood. We developed statistical models that incorporated microbiome data with clinical and demographic data to better understand why individuals develop CDI. The 16S rRNA genes were sequenced from the feces of 338 individuals, including cases, diarrheal controls, and nondiarrheal controls. We modeled CDI and diarrheal status using multiple clinical variables, including age, antibiotic use, antacid use, and other known risk factors using logit regression. This base model was compared to models that incorporated microbiome data, using diversity metrics, community types, or specific bacterial populations, to identify characteristics of the microbiome associated with CDI susceptibility or resistance. The addition of microbiome data significantly improved our ability to distinguish CDI status when comparing cases or diarrheal controls to nondiarrheal controls. However, only when we assigned samples to community types was it possible to differentiate cases from diarrheal controls. Several bacterial species within the Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Bacteroides, and Porphyromonadaceae were largely absent in cases and highly associated with nondiarrheal controls. The improved discriminatory ability of our microbiome-based models confirms the theory that factors affecting the microbiome influence CDI. IMPORTANCE The gut microbiome, composed of the trillions of bacteria residing in the gastrointestinal tract, is responsible for a number of critical functions within the host. These include digestion, immune system stimulation, and colonization resistance. The microbiome's role in colonization resistance, which is the ability to prevent and limit pathogen colonization and growth, is key for protection against Clostridium difficile infections. However, the bacteria that are important for colonization resistance have not yet been elucidated. Using statistical modeling techniques and different representations of the microbiome, we demonstrated that several community types and the loss of several bacterial populations, including Bacteroides, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae, are associated with CDI. Our results emphasize the importance of considering the microbiome in mediating colonization resistance and may also direct the design of future multispecies probiotic therapies.},

It cannot be used everywhere, as it does not always give values which are independent of sample size ; it cannot do so, for example, when applied to an infinite population of individuals classified into a finite number of groups.

  abstract = {,  Objective: To determine whether the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) severity criteria adequately predicts poor outcomes. Design: Retrospective validation study. Setting and participants: Patients with CDI in the Veterans' Affairs Health System from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2016. Methods: For the 2010 criteria, patients with leukocytosis or a serum creatinine (SCr) value {$\geq$}1.5 times the baseline were classified as severe. For the 2018 criteria, patients with leukocytosis or a SCr value {$\geq$}1.5 mg/dL were classified as severe. Poor outcomes were defined as hospital or intensive care admission within 7 days of diagnosis, colectomy within 14 days, or 30-day all-cause mortality; they were modeled as a function of the 2010 and 2018 criteria separately using logistic regression. Results: We analyzed data from 86,112 episodes of CDI. Severity was unclassifiable in a large proportion of episodes diagnosed in subacute care (2010, 58.8\%; 2018, 49.2\%). Sensitivity ranged from 0.48 for subacute care using 2010 criteria to 0.73 for acute care using 2018 criteria. Areas under the curve were poor and similar (0.60 for subacute care and 0.57 for acute care) for both versions, but negative predictive values were {$>$}0.80. Conclusions: Model performances across care settings and criteria versions were generally poor but had reasonably high negative predictive value. Many patients in the subacute-care setting, an increasing fraction of CDI cases, could not be classified. More work is needed to develop criteria to identify patients at risk of poor outcomes.},

  abstract = {Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most common nosocomial infection in hospitals. Despite the fact that CDI has treatment options, recurrence is common after the treatment, recurrence will occur in approximately 20\%-35\% of people initially affected, with 40\%-60\% of these having a second recurrence. Patients are more likely to have several recurrences after the second, which can lead to antibiotic overuse, and as a result, CDI-related health care expenses, hospitalizations, and mortality are on the rise. The first treatment to receive~Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the prevention of C. difficile recurrence is bezlotoxumab, a novel human monoclonal antibody against C. difficile toxin B. In the present systematic review, we assessed various studies from PubMed, PubMed Central (PMC), Google Scholar, and Science direct that evaluated the efficacy of bezlotoxumab in the prevention of recurrent C. difficile (rCDI), and we also briefly discussed the pathophysiology of C. difficile and the risk factors for recurrence of C. difficile. The major MODIFY trial has proven the efficacy, pooled analysis of MODIFY 1 AND 2 trials demonstrated the following results as compared to placebo (bezlotoxumab: 129/781 [16.5] placebo:206/773 [26.6] -10.0\% [95\% CI -14.0 to -6.0], p\&lt;0.0001) with number needed to treat (NNT) of 10. All other observational studies also showed a positive response with bezlotoxumab in the prevention of C. difficile. In conclusion, bezlotoxumab is a great option adjunctive with standard of care~CDI antibiotics for the prevention of rCDI in high-risk adults.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) modeling of the human microbiome has the potential to identify microbial biomarkers and aid in the diagnosis of many diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and colorectal cancer. Progress has been made toward developing ML models that predict health outcomes using bacterial abundances, but inconsistent adoption of training and evaluation methods call the validity of these models into question. Furthermore, there appears to be a preference by many researchers to favor increased model complexity over interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we trained seven models that used fecal 16S rRNA sequence data to predict the presence of colonic screen relevant neoplasias (SRNs) (n = 490 patients, 261 controls and 229 cases). We developed a reusable open-source pipeline to train, validate, and interpret ML models. To show the effect of model selection, we assessed the predictive performance, interpretability, and training time of L2-regularized logistic regression, L1- and L2-regularized support vector machines (SVM) with linear and radial basis function kernels, a decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosted trees (XGBoost). The random forest model performed best at detecting SRNs with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.695 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.651 to 0.739) but was slow to train (83.2 h) and not inherently interpretable. Despite its simplicity, L2-regularized logistic regression followed random forest in predictive performance with an AUROC of 0.680 (IQR, 0.625 to 0.735), trained faster (12 min), and was inherently interpretable. Our analysis highlights the importance of choosing an ML approach based on the goal of the study, as the choice will inform expectations of performance and interpretability. IMPORTANCE Diagnosing diseases using machine learning (ML) is rapidly being adopted in microbiome studies. However, the estimated performance associated with these models is likely overoptimistic. Moreover, there is a trend toward using black box models without a discussion of the difficulty of interpreting such models when trying to identify microbial biomarkers of disease. This work represents a step toward developing more-reproducible ML practices in applying ML to microbiome research. We implement a rigorous pipeline and emphasize the importance of selecting ML models that reflect the goal of the study. These concepts are not particular to the study of human health but can also be applied to environmental microbiology studies.},

Although this has been an active area of research, it has been difficult to overcome the time and memory demands while improving the quality of the OTU assignments. Here, we developed a new OTU assignment algorithm that iteratively reassigns sequences to new OTUs to optimize the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), a measure of the quality of OTU assignments. To assess the new algorithm, OptiClust, we compared it to 10 other algorithms using 16S rRNA gene sequences from two simulated and four natural communities. Using the OptiClust algorithm, the MCC values averaged 15.2 and 16.5\% higher than the OTUs generated when we used the average neighbor and distance-based greedy clustering with VSEARCH, respectively. Furthermore, on average, OptiClust was 94.6 times faster than the average neighbor algorithm and just as fast as distance-based greedy clustering with VSEARCH. An empirical analysis of the efficiency of the algorithms showed that the time and memory required to perform the algorithm scaled quadratically with the number of unique sequences in the data set. The significant improvement in the quality of the OTU assignments over previously existing methods will significantly enhance downstream analysis by limiting the splitting of similar sequences into separate OTUs and merging of dissimilar sequences into the same OTU. The development of the OptiClust algorithm represents a significant advance that is likely to have numerous other applications.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of electronic medical records holds out the promise of using machine learning and data mining to build models that will help healthcare providers improve patient outcomes. However, building useful models from these datasets presents many technical problems. Among the challenges are the large number of factors (both intrinsic and extrinsic) influencing a patient's risk of an adverse outcome, the inherent evolution of that risk over time, and the relative rarity of adverse outcomes, institutional differences and the lack of ground truth. In this thesis we tackle these challenges in the context of predicting healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). HAIs are a serious problem in US acute care hospitals, affecting approximately 4\% of all inpatients on any given day. Despite best efforts to reduce incidence, HAIs remain stubbornly prevalent. We hypothesize that one of the reasons why is lack of an effective clinical tool for accurately measuring patient risk. Therefore, we develop accurate models for predicting which patients are at risk of acquiring an infection with Clostridium difficile (a common HAI). In contrast to previous work, we take a novel data-centric approach, leveraging the contents of EMRs from over 100,000 hospital admissions. We show how, by adapting techniques from time-series classification, transfer learning and multitask learning, we can learn more accurate models for patient risk stratification. Our model, based on thousands of variables both time-varying and time-invariant, does not remain static but changes over the course of a patient admission. Applied to a held-out validation set of 25,000 patient admissions. our model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81 (95\% CI 0.78-0.84). The model has been successfully integrated into the health record system at a large hospital in the US, and is being used to produce daily risk estimates for each inpatient. While more complex than traditional risk stratification methods, the widespread development and use of such data-driven models could ultimately enable cost-effective, targeted prevention strategies that reduce the incidence of HAIs.},

  abstract = {Background. Although many risk factors are well known, Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) continues to be a significant problem throughout the world. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a data-driven, hospital-specific risk stratification procedure for estimating the probability that an inpatient will test positive for C difficile. Methods. We consider electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients admitted for {$\geq$}24 hours to a large urban hospital in the U.S. between April 2011 and April 2013. Predictive models were constructed using L2-regularized logistic regression and data from the first year. The number of observational variables considered varied from a small set of well known risk factors readily available to a physician to over 10 000 variables automatically extracted from the EMR. Each model was evaluated on holdout admission data from the following year. A total of 34 846 admissions with 372 cases of CDI was used to train the model. Results. Applied to the separate validation set of 34 722 admissions with 355 cases of CDI, the model that made use of the additional EMR data yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.81 (95\% confidence interval [CI], .79\textendash.83), and it significantly outperformed the model that considered only the small set of known clinical risk factors, AUROC of 0.71 (95\% CI, .69\textendash.75). Conclusions. Automated risk stratification of patients based on the contents of their EMRs can be used to accurately identify a high-risk population of patients. The proposed method holds promise for enabling the selective allocation of interventions aimed at reducing the rate of CDI.},
